## DAYS

This is my personal project aimed at simplifying the lives of digital nomads. Constantly shifting countries can make it challenging to keep track of visa days. This application is designed to automate day counting. Additionally, it serves as a tool for tracking your journeys.

Currently, the application is in the development phase, and I am utilizing it to learn Swift. In the near future, I plan to release it on the AppStore. But now you can see my code [here](https://github.com/OlegYakushin/Days).
