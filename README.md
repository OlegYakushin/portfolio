# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing some of my exciting projects in the world of swift development!

# iOS projects

## DAYS

This is my personal project aimed at simplifying the lives of digital nomads. Constantly shifting countries can make it challenging to keep track of visa days. This application is designed to automate day counting. Additionally, it serves as a tool for tracking your journeys.

Currently, the application in the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/days/id6464660094)

</div>


## WordGame

This is a game for learning new words. 5 languages supported, Turkish, English, Spanish, French and German. The game consists of levels, each level contains 6 words. 
Soon this game will be published in the AppStore.

You can see my code [here](https://github.com/OlegYakushin/WordGame)

## Scrumdinger 

This application is widely recognized as a SwiftUI learning template. I've chosen to enhance this application with new features and expand its reach by introducing localization for another language.

You can see my code [here](https://github.com/OlegYakushin/Storygenerator)

## MathApp

I'm currently working on this application, designed to streamline communication between teachers and students. It offers various levels with assignments and the capability to join lessons. Since the client doesn't have a precise design but rather a concept and a similar application in the AppStore, I've written all the code from scratch.

You can see my code [here](https://github.com/OlegYakushin/MathApp)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
<img width="295" height="639" src="/MathApp/Math1.png" alt="Math1">

  <img width="295" height="639" src="/MathApp/Math3.png" alt="Math3">

## Math Chat

This application is designed for macOS. Essentially, it's a chat interface design (similar to the Telegram app). Eventually, this application will be used for communication between teachers and students.
